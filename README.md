## AVAILABILITY DATABASE

This project involves creating a database that stores delays of relevant assets on a mine.
The assets are 
            
            1. Compressors
            
            2. Refrigeration Plants
            
            3. Vent Fans
            
            4. Substations
            
            5. Other services
            
 I am going to create a database with the help of flask_sqlalchemy and mysql, connect it to Microsoft PowerBi and make a report on the availability of these assets.
